Notes about the following list of commands:

- Items in square brackets are optional.

  e.g `n/NAME [d/DATE]` can be used as `n/burger d/2021-10-20` or as `n/burger`
- Parameters with tags or optional modifiers can be in any order.

  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME` `a/AMOUNT`, `a/AMOUNT` `n/NAME` is also acceptable.
- If a parameter is expected only once in the command but if you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.

  e.g. if you specify `a/10 a/15`, only `a/10` will be taken.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `budget` and `exit`)
  will be ignored.

  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
