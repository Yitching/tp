### <a name="sys-arch"></a>System Architecture

![](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The above **System Architecture** diagram shows the high-level design of Mint.

On launch, the `Main` class initialises the app components in the correct sequence and links them up with each other, in
the correct sequence.

Apart from `Main`, Mint comprises six main components, namely:

- `Ui`: The UI of the App 
- `Logic`: Make sense of user input and execute command
- `Model`: Holds the data of the App
- `DataManager`: Reads from and writes to [`LocalStorage`](#local-storage).

The components interact with each other, as shown in the sequence diagram below.

![](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

### <a name="text-ui"></a>Ui Component

![](images/Ui.png)

The UI consists of a `Ui` class that represents the interface that the user interacts with.

The Ui component,

* takes in user inputs.
* pass them either to the `Logic` component or `Storage` component.
* outputs entries requested by the user.

### <a name="logic"></a>Logic Component
Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component.

![](images/Logic.png)

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to parse a command, it uses `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. The `Parser` prepares to return a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its </br >
subclasses e.g.,`AddRecurringCommand`) by parsing the arguments and verifying through `ValidityChecker` class.
3. `Parser` encapsulates the details of the query as an `Entry` object from `Model`.
4. `Parser` returns a `Command` object, which is executed by `Main`.
5. The `Command` can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed </br>
6. The `Command` saves the resulting data by using the `Storage`.
7. The result is printed to the user by the `Ui`.
   (e.g. to add a recurring entry)

The Seuquence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the</br>
`parseCommand("delete a/12")` API call.
![](images/LogicSequenceDiagram.png)
### <a name="model"></a>Model Component
The `Model` package consists of two components: `Finance` and `Budget`.
##### <a name="finance"></a>Finance Component
![](images/Finance.png)

The `Finance` component,
- stores all the entry data i.e., all `Entry` objects (which are contained in `FinancialManager` object).
  - `NormalFinanceManager` object stores all the `Income` and `Expense` objects
  - `RecurringFinanceManager` stores all the `RecurringIncome` and `RecurringExpense` objects
- performs action on the list of `Entry` objects (e.g., add, delete, etc.)
- depends on Ui component as some action needs confirmation from the user (e.g. For delete, </br>
if there are multiple entries that match the tags the user specified, the user needs to choose which one to delete.)
#### <a name="budget"></a>Budget Component

#### <a name="budget"></a>Budget
![](images/Budget.png)

The `Budget` package consists of a `BudgetManager` and the `Budget`'s each of the seven `ExpenseCategory`'s.
- `Budget` is an abstract class
- `XYZBudget`(`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specified budget e.g., `FoodBudget`), inherits `Budget` and its attributes.
- `BudgetManager` stores a list of the seven `ExpenseCategory`'s.
- Currently, `BudgetManager` only interacts in 2 ways
    - when user want to set budget for a specific category
    - when other parts of the app requires the list of budgets e.g., `Ui` needs the list to print to the user, or 
      `FinanceManager` needs to know if the user is nearing their spending limit to notify them.

### <a name="contact-list"></a>ExpenseList

### <a name="storage"></a>Storage Component

**How the `Storage` component works:**

**1. Loading the lists from the stored files:**

![](images/StorageLoadFiles.png)
> For ease of visualization, since the logic for all the different lists are the same, we have broken it down to show
> one example using the diagram

1. When the program is executed, all the objects including the `BudgetDataManager`, `DataManagerActions`, 
   `NormalListDataManager` and `RecurringListDataManager` would be created. 
2. The programme would then load all the stored content from the lists which records the user's previously recorded
   normal expenditure, recurring expenditure, and the spending limits they set for each category.
3. Upon detection, missing text files, and the required directory would be created.

**2. General logic for each command:**

![](images/Storage.png)

1. After the command is extracted from the `Parser`, `Duke` would call the respective command class. In the case of
   the add function, the `AddCommand` class would be called.
2. In the `AddCommand` class, after the add command has been successfully performed, a method call to 
   `appendToEntryListTextFile` would activate the `NormalListDataManager` class for which the added entry would be 
   appended to an external text file.
   
**The `Storage` component:**
1. Can save all the `recurringEntryList`, `budgetList` and the `entryList` in a text file. It is also able to read the 
   data from the respective text files and read them back into the corresponding objects.
2. Has four different classes. `DataManagerActions` comprises the common components used by the other two classes,
   `BudgetListDataManager`, `RecurringListDataManager` and `NormalListDataManager`. All of these classes inherit from 
   the `DataManagerActions` class.
